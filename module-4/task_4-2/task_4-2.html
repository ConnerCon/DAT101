      <li>1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
<p>An array stores multiple values in one variable.</p>

<li>2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
<p>It means writing fixed values directly in the code.</p>

<li>3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
(humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
<p>We use a loop that runs until the end of the array, like foreach.</p>

<li>4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
<p>So we can easily manage and loop over many objects.</p>

<li>5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
"Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
participate in the competition!)</li>
<p>It groups days of the week,value is the day name. WeekDay is one day, Workdays are Monday–Friday, Weekends are Saturday–Sunday. WorkoutDays would be Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday.</p>

<li>6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
<p>It compares two items and tells the sort which one comes first.</p>

<li>7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.</li>
<p>The array compares two elements at a time to decide their order.</p>

<li>8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
contains.</li>
<p>It contains the first row of the table.</p>
