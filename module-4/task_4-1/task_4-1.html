      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>Object-oriented development is important because it helps structure code, makes it reusable, easier to maintain, and easier to understand.</p>
      <li>[In T ask 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>It is used to store fixed values, like constants. This makes the code clearer and reduces mistakes from using hard-coded values.</p>
      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>Encapsulation is used so the inside of a class doesn’t get messed with by accident. We hide parts of the code to keep things safe and easier to control. Public members use this and private members are just variables inside the constructor.</p>
      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>When you use new JavaScript creates a new object, sets this to it, links it to the function, and gives the object back. </p>
