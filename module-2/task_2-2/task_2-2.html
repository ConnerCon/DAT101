      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				Use constants for values that should not change throughout the program, for example fixed values like pi. Use variables for values that may change during the execution of the program, like the user input or counters. Not all values can be constants because some need to be variables to allow for flexibility.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parentheses affect the order of operations in an expression. Operations within the parentheses are performed first.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We can use the toFixed() method to limit the number of decimals. Example: 3.1415.toFixed(2) gives '3.14'.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
			We can use 12.99999 == 12.2 to compare them directly, the operators will then return false.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators return a boolean value "true or false". We can check if they are false or true by using conditional statements like if-else or by going directly to the console.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) "let x = Math.random() * 1". It can be used for creating random values for games, simulations, or any scenario where unpredictability is wanted.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. It is used to determine if a number is even or odd.
