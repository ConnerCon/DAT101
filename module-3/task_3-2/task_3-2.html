      <li>[Is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>Yes, for simple counting tasks a single for loop works, but for guessing a number you cannot use a for loop because you don’t know how many guesses are needed.</p>
      <li>[Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of your answer.]</li>
      <p>Yes, by using while(true). You need a break inside to stop the loop when the correct condition is met.</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>The computer is fast, but the number of guesses is random. While guessing, the program focuses on the loop and does not do other tasks at the same time.</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
matter?]</li>
      <p>The outer loop usually controls rows and the inner loop controls columns. You can swap them, but it changes the order in which cells are processed or printed.</p>
